        <br>
        <p>Model–view–controller (MVC) is a software architectural pattern for implementing user interfaces. It divides a given software application into three interconnected parts, so as to separate internal representations of information from the ways that information is presented to or accepted from the user.</p>

        <p style="font-size:12px;">So <strong>Why Rails</strong>
        <br><br>
        <b>Pros and cons of Rails</b>
        <br><br>
        <strong>Why use Ruby on Rails:</strong>
        <br><br>
        The process of programming is much faster than with other frameworks and languages, partly because of the object-oriented nature of Ruby and the vast library of open source code available within the Rails community.
        <br><br>
        The Rails conventions also make it easy for developers to move between different Rails projects, as each project will tend to follow the same structure and coding practices.
        <br><br>
        Rails is good for rapid development, as the framework makes it easy to accommodate changes.
        Ruby code is very readable and mostly self-documenting. This increases productivity, as there is less need to write out separate documentation, making it easier for other developers to pick up existing projects.
        <br><br>
        Rails has developed a strong focus on testing, and has good testing frameworks.
        <br><br>
        Rails and most of its libraries are open source, so unlike other commercial development frameworks there are no licensing costs involved.
        <br><br>
        <br><br>
        <strong>Potential Rails problems and limitations and how to overcome them:</strong>
        <br><br>
        Not all website hosts can support Rails.
        <br><br>
        While it is true that not all web hosts support Rails, this is primarily because it can be more resource intensive than PHP, a fact which deters low-end shared-hosting providers. However, this is by no means a deal-breaker, and of course Rails-friendly hosts do exist, for example, Heroku and EngineYard.
        <br><br>
        Alternatively, you can host your Rails application on a Virtual Private Server (VPS) with Amazon EC2, Rackspace, or Linode. You will then have full control over the server and can allocate sufficient resources for your application.
        <br><br>
        Java and PHP are more widely used, and there are more developers in these languages 
        <br><br>
        The number of Ruby developers is growing year on year as more people switch to it from other programming languages. One of the main differences between the Ruby and other communities is the amount of open source code (gems) which is publicly available, as of writing there are 63,711 gems which you can use to enhance your application.
        <br><br>
        <strong>Performance and Scalability</strong>
        <br><br>There have been concerns that Rails applications are not as fast as Java or C, which is true, but for the majority of applications it is fast enough. There are plenty of high profile organisations which rely on Rails to power their sites including AirBnB, Yellow Pages, Groupon, Channel 5, and Gov.uk.
        <br><br>
        There is also the option of running your application under JRuby and then you have the same performance characteristics as Java.

        <p style="font-size:16px;color:white;">        <br><br><strong>GET<br></strong><br>
        Requests a representation of the specified resource. Requests using GET should only retrieve data and should have no other effect. (This is also true of some other HTTP methods.)[1] The W3C has published guidance principles on this distinction, saying, "Web application design should be informed by the above principles, but also by the relevant limitations."[13] See safe methods below.
        <br><br><strong>HEAD<br></strong><br>
        Asks for the response identical to the one that would correspond to a GET request, but without the response body. This is useful for retrieving meta-information written in response headers, without having to transport the entire content.
        <br><br><strong>POST<br></strong><br>
        Requests that the server accept the entity enclosed in the request as a new subordinate of the web resource identified by the URI. The data POSTed might be, for example, an annotation for existing resources; a message for a bulletin board, newsgroup, mailing list, or comment thread; a block of data that is the result of submitting a web form to a data-handling process; or an item to add to a database.[14]
        <br><br><strong>PUT<br></strong><br>
        Requests that the enclosed entity be stored under the supplied URI. If the URI refers to an already existing resource, it is modified; if the URI does not point to an existing resource, then the server can create the resource with that URI.[15]

        <p style="font-size:16px;color:white;"><br><br><strong>DELETE<br></strong><br>
        Deletes the specified resource.
        <br><br><strong>TRACE<br></strong><br>
        Echoes back the received request so that a client can see what (if any) changes or additions have been made by intermediate servers.
        <br><br><strong>OPTIONS<br></strong><br>
        Returns the HTTP methods that the server supports for the specified URL. This can be used to check the functionality of a web server by requesting '*' instead of a specific resource.
        <br><br><strong>CONNECT[16]<br></strong><br>
        Converts the request connection to a transparent TCP/IP tunnel, usually to facilitate SSL-encrypted communication (HTTPS) through an unencrypted HTTP proxy.[17][18] See HTTP CONNECT tunneling.
        <br><br><strong>PATCH<br></strong><br>
        Applies partial modifications to a resource.[19]
        HTTP servers are required to implement at least the GET and HEAD methods[20] and, whenever possible, also the OPTIONS method.[citation needed]
